## Pipeline summary

Via a single file of ids, provided one-per-line the pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Resolve database ids to be compatible with EBI API
2. Fetch extensive id metadata including direct download links to FastQ files via ENA API
3. Download FastQ files in parallel via `curl` and perform `md5sum` check
4. Collate id metadata and paths to FastQ files in a single samplesheet
